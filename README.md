# OOP-School-Library`
Here in this project I have created a class `Person` with the following:
- Instance vars: `@id`, `@name`, and `@age`.
- Constructor with `name`, `age`, and `parent_permission` as parameter. name and `parent_permission` are optional and have default values of `"Unknown"` and `true`.
- Getters for `@id`, `@name`, and `@age`.
- Setters for `@name` and `@age`.
- Private method `is_of_age?` that returns `true` if `@age` is greater or equal to 18 and false otherwise.
